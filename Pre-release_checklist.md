# Pre-release checklist

Always make sure to test your website thoroughly before releasing it to the public. This checklist includes some of the
most important things to check before launching a website.

**Feel free to fork this repository and add your own items to the checklist.**

1. Check all image sizes: Ensure that images are optimized and not larger than necessary to minimize loading times and
   improve website performance.

2. Style and test the 404 page: Make sure that the 404 error page is designed and functional, providing a user-friendly
   experience when users encounter broken links or unavailable content.

3. Verify analytics tools: Confirm that analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, are correctly implemented to track
   website traffic, user behavior, and other relevant metrics.

4. Test form submissions: Thoroughly test all forms on the website to ensure they submit data correctly and deliver it
   to the intended destination (e.g., email, database).

5. Check metadata and SEO elements: Verify that important metadata, including the title, description, keywords, and Open
   Graph (og:image) tags, are properly set to optimize search engine visibility and improve website SEO.

6. Click all links for correct navigation: Click on all internal and external links to verify they lead to the intended
   sections or pages of the website.

7. Review footer for legal content: Check the footer section to ensure it includes important legal content, such as
   Terms of Service (TOS), Privacy Policy, and other relevant information.

8. Ensure keyboard navigability: Test the website's navigation using only a keyboard to ensure that users who rely on
   keyboard navigation can access all content and functionalities.

9. Ensure cross-browser compatibility: Test the website on different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
   to ensure consistent functionality and appearance across all major browsers.

10. Verify responsive design: Test the website's responsiveness on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that it
    adapts and displays properly, providing a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

11. Implement accessibility standards: Ensure the website meets accessibility standards, including color contrast,
    keyboard navigation, and compatibility with screen readers, to make it usable for individuals with disabilities.

12. Provide alt tags for images: Add descriptive alt tags to images for improved accessibility and search engine
    optimization.

13. Maintain consistent typography: Ensure consistent typography throughout the website for better readability and a
    cohesive design.

14. Check color scheme consistency: Verify that the color scheme is consistent across the website, maintaining brand
    identity and enhancing the overall visual appeal.

15. Test interactive elements: Thoroughly test interactive elements like dropdown menus, sliders, and forms to ensure
    they
    function correctly and provide a smooth user experience.

16. Ensure logical URL structure: Establish a logical and user-friendly URL structure that aligns with the website's
    content
    hierarchy and improves search engine visibility. Create a redirection map to redirect old URLs to new ones if
    necessary.

17. Verify social media links: Check that social media links are correctly implemented and direct users to the
    appropriate
    social media profiles.

18. Validate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code: Use code validation tools to ensure that the website's HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript code is error-free and adheres to web standards.

19. Ensure website security: Implement HTTPS, verify SSL certificate validity, and follow security best practices to
    protect
    user data and maintain a secure browsing experience.

20. Address cookie and privacy notices: Ensure that the website complies with relevant cookie and privacy regulations by
    implementing necessary notices and obtaining user consent. Don't implement overwhelming cookie banners that
    negatively impact the user experience.

21. Verify third-party plugin integration: Test and confirm the integration and functionality of any third-party plugins or
tools used on the website. Remove any unnecessary plugins to improve website performance.

22. Include a README.md setup guide: Create a detailed step-by-step guide in the README.md file to assist developers in
setting up the local environment required to work on the website.

23. Create .env.example file: Provide a sample .env file with example environment variable configurations to guide
developers in setting up the necessary environment variables for the website.

24. Check the Network tab to ensure all assets are loading correctly and quickly.

25. Check the Console tab for any errors.

26. Check the Lighthouse tab for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

**And finally, ask a colleague to test the website and provide feedback BEFORE presenting the website to the client or releasing it to the public.**
